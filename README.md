I am a 26 year old software developer who was sick of repetitive admin work, and so enrolled in Makers Academy 16-week coding bootcamp in May 2018. I graduated in August 2018 after thoroughly enjoying the course, and I am currently looking for my first Junior Developer position.

[//]: # (## About Me I've always enjoyed problem solving and fixing things, so programming has turned out to be a natural fit for me, while also providing the chance to build something and be creative. I got into programming I am a thoroughly social person, who works best as part of a team, and thrives on collaborative problem solving. While it's not my preference, I am also perfectly capable of working and learning independently, however.)

## Projects

The Makers course focusses on pair programming, test driven development, agile processes, and learning by doing. You can see my progression throughout the course on (my Github)[https://github.com/JohnForster], but see below for a few select projects to demonstrate what I have learnt over the last 12 weeks:

| Title    | Description |Timeframe| Technologies|
| -------- | --------|--------| -------- |
|[Hip Hip Array][1] | Final project at Makers, an educational tool for beginner coders to help find array methods in three languages.|10 Days|React, Express, Javascript, Ruby and Python|
|[Bank Tech Test][2]| An example tech test, written in ruby to demonstrate TDD, OOP and clean code principles.|1 Day|Ruby|
|[Game of Life][3]| An implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in React as an example tech test.|1 Day|React, Javascript|
| [Acebook][4]| A clone of facebook, including log-in functionality, posts, comments and likes. This was my first project using React. |2 Weeks| Ruby, Rails, HTML|
| [PiratesBNB][5] | A pirate-themed clone of AirBNB, where sea-curious landlubbers can hire a ship for weekend marauding.|1 Week| Ruby, Sinatra, SQL, Node, Express, Javascript, jQuery, Jade, HTML, CSS|
| [Airport Challenge][6]     | A project written after one week of the course to get to grips with OOD, and SOLID principles|2 Days| Ruby|

## Skills

#### Clean Code Advocate

Over the course of the Makers bootcamp, I have developed a strong understanding of the ideas behind writing clean code, and take care to ensure that the code I write is test driven, DRY, and follows [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).

#### Good Problem Solver

#### Fast Learner

#### Good Team Player

I work best as part of a team, and thrive on collaborative problem solving. I am a good communicator, and I'm sure to make the effort to understand differing viewpoints when they arise. I come up with my best ideas when I have someone else to bounce them off, and find the social aspect of group work motivating and energising.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June 2018 - August 2018)
*16 week coding bootcamp which focuses on a number of principles and technologies:*
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile Processes
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Express, Node, Python, PostgreSQL, Heroku

#### Edinburgh University (Graduated June 2017)
*Chemistry BSc*

My dissertation centered around the non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation (NPLIN) of sugars. I chose this because a) it sounds impressive, and b) working with lasers sounded one hell of a lot cooler than it ended up being.

#### School
A Levels in Maths, Chemistry and Drama, all at A* Grade.

11 GCSEs at A* Grade.

## Experience

**Court of Protection** (February 2018 to June 2018)   
*Admin Officer for the case progression branch*

Handled applications to the Court of Protection from the public for permission to make financial or personal welfare decisions on someone elses behalf.

**Health Education England** (August 2017 to February 2018)    
*Quality Support Officer*

Was responsible for observing panels on the treatment of medical students around London and the South East, writing reports on the findings, and tracking the findings as points for improvement at the hospitals.

**King's College Hospital** (June 2017 to August 2017)    
*Admin Officer*

Carried out audits of emergency hospital equipment, to ensure that they were in good condition and being checked regularly by the nursing staff. Also assisted in the running of resuscitation courses teaching trainee doctors how to perform advanced life support.

**Barburrito** (September 2016 to June 2017)    
*Team Leader*

Made and rolled burritos. As Team Leader I was responsible for running the shop when other managers weren't around. This included managing the team, cashing up, and being responsible for closing the shop at the end of the night.

## Interests
I am a very sociable person with a keen interest in film and music. I have attended Glastonbury Festival every year since I was 10. I play guitar, but I'm nowhere near as proficient as I should be considering I started ten years ago. My favourite sports are table tennis and squash, and I also occasionally play overly-complex board games with friends. I'm generally down for trying pretty much anything with a good group of people.
