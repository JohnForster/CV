I am a 26 year old software developer who was sick of repetitive admin work, and so enrolled in Makers Academy 16-week coding bootcamp in May 2018. I graduated in August 2018 after thoroughly enjoying the course, and I am currently looking for my first Junior Developer position.

[//]: # (## About Me I've always enjoyed problem solving and fixing things, so programming has turned out to be a natural fit for me, while also providing the chance to build something and be creative. I got into programming I am a thoroughly social person, who works best as part of a team, and thrives on collaborative problem solving. While it's not my preference, I am also perfectly capable of working and learning independently, however.)

## Interests
I am a very sociable person with a keen interest in film and music. I have attended Glastonbury Festival every year since I was 10. I play guitar, but I'm nowhere near as proficient as I should be considering I started ten years ago. My favourite sports are table tennis and squash, and I also occasionally play overly-complex board games with friends. I'm generally down for trying pretty much anything with a good group of people.
