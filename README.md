## John Forster

I am a 26 year old who is sick of repetitive admin work, and looking for new challenges in a new area where I can shine.

## Skills

#### Programming

Self-taught in my spare time over the last year or so. I started by programming basic games in Unity with C#, before deciding to give my career a kick up the arse and attend the Makers' Academy. As a result of this decision, I started learning Ruby to prepare for the course.

#### Edinburgh University (Graduated June 2017)

- My dissertation centered around the non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation (NPLIN) of sugars. I chose this because a) it sounds impressive, and b) working with lasers sounded one hell of a lot cooler than it ended up being.
